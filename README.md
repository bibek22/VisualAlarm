Usage:
---------
* takes the time(in seconds) as first command line argument and  the message to be reminded as the second.
* sleep for the t seconds and send a desktop notification using notify-send with the message as the content.

Note:
* The clock icon goes into the same folder as the bash script. It will still work if otherwise, but the little clock
   icon on the notification is gone. Who wants that!
